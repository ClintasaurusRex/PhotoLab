# PhotoLabs

PhotoLabs is a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) built with React. It allows users to explore, view, and interact with a collection of high-quality photographs.

## Features

- Browse a diverse collection of photos on the homepage
- Navigate through different photo categories (topics)
- View enlarged versions of photos with related/similar images
- Like photos from anywhere within the application
- Receive visual feedback for liked photos via a heart icon in the navigation bar
- Responsive design for seamless use across devices

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- API: RESTful JSON API

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. `/frontend`: Contains the React SPA
2. `/backend`: Houses the Express.js server and PostgreSQL database

## Setup and Installation

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `/backend` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Set up the PostgreSQL database (see backend README for detailed instructions)
4. Start the server with `npm start`

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.


## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and personalized photo collections
- Advanced searching for photos
-

This project showcases proficiency in modern web development practices, including:

- Building scalable SPAs with React
- Developing RESTful APIs
- Database design and management
- Frontend-backend integration
